##   Our Site

The site is classified as a Gallery site which means that we will use HTML and CSS to put images and style how they will appear to the site visitors.

#### **The Site Design:**

the site will conatain 3 pages:

**1. Main page**

  This page will be the home page and it will contain:
  * **Header**:
   the header will contain the logo and navigation bar to make it easy for the user to explore it
  * **The Body**:
   The body will contain the main content (**Images**) styled with **CSS** to make it appear in an attractive way. The images  will  be classified regarading their category. Categories are like Nature, People, etc.
   
 * **The Footer:**
  The footer will contain Social media icons such as Facebook, Linkedin, instgram, etc. in addition to few other links.
  
   
   To have a better idea about the main page layout, have a look at the images below:

# Team Members Journey while desiging (From the start to the end)

In our journey to finish designing the site we will divide the work into steps:

1. The first step will be creating a repository on GitHub
2. The second step will be dividing the work and creating issues regarding every issue
3. The third step will be assinging every issue to a member who will start working on it 
4. after the team member finishes his work on a certain issue, he/she will push it to the Github repository and wait every team member to view his work and approve it or request changes
5. if the pull request was approved and merged, the member will move to another issue to work on it.
6. the previous step will be repeated until the site finishes.

Our team members will use **HTML** & **CSS**.
